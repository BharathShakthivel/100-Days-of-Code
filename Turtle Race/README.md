# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

A fun Python project built with the `turtle` graphics library where multiple turtles race across the screen, and you get to bet on which one will win! 🎉

---

## 🚀 How It Works

* When you run the program, you'll be asked to place a bet on a turtle by choosing a color.
* The turtles (each with a different color) start from the left side of the screen.
* They race toward the right side, moving forward by a random distance each turn.
* The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
* If your bet matches the winning turtle’s color, you win. Otherwise, you lose.
