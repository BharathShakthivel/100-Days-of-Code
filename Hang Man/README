## 🕹️ Hangman Game – Python Terminal Version

This is a simple text-based Hangman game built using Python. The player guesses letters of a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends.

## 🧠 Key Concepts and Terminology

### ✅ Imports and Modules

* `random`: Built-in Python module to randomly select a word from the list.
* `hangman_words`: Custom module containing a predefined list of words (`word_list`).
* `hangman_art`: Custom module that includes:

  * `logo`: ASCII art logo displayed at the start.
  * `stages`: List of ASCII art strings representing the hangman for each stage of the game.

### 🎮 Game Variables

* `lives`: Number of chances (6) the player has to guess the word.
* `chosen_word`: Random word selected from `word_list` for the player to guess.
* `placeholder`: String of underscores (`_`) representing unguessed letters in the word.
* `correct_letters`: List to store correctly guessed letters.
* `game_over`: Boolean flag used to control when the game ends.

### 🔁 Game Loop Logic

* Runs continuously using `while not game_over` until the player either:

  * Wins (by guessing all letters), or
  * Loses (by running out of lives).
* Prompts the user for a guess (`input().lower()`), ensures consistency by converting input to lowercase.
* Updates the displayed word if a correct letter is guessed.
* Deducts a life and shows a message if the guess is incorrect.
* Ends the game and prints the outcome based on win/loss.

### 🖼️ Visual Feedback

* `logo` is shown at the start of the game.
* `stages[lives]` is printed after each guess to visually represent progress/failure.
* The current word (with correctly guessed letters and remaining underscores) is displayed after each guess.

2. Run the main game script:

   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure that `hangman_words.py` and `hangman_art.py` are in the same directory as `hangman.py`.
* This game is played entirely in the terminal and is beginner-friendly.
